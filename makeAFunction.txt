This commit is before I make the entire pokerStats.py script a function. This allows the following functionality:

1. Function can be called more than once during a single run. This allows multiple dates and poker types to be filled, which is very helpful for a GUI. 
*This function will be run from a separate script called runPokerStats.py.

2. Function will not execute when it is imported to runPokerStats.py until it is called using runPokerStats(arg1, arg2). 

3. Input arguments (date, handTypeDesired) are much easier to handle, and can be sent to pokerStats easily.

4. A GUI can be designed in runPokerStats.py (or in a separate script or function) that assigns input variables, runs pokerStats() when prompted, and confirms output is in Excel files or command line.
